        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Rochele Fernandez, a second year student passionate about programming and building innovative projects. I'm currently interested in data science and machine learning because I enjoy exploring datasets, identifying patterns, and developing models that can produce meaningful insights. Asides from my interest, I work as a part time academic Mathematics & Science Tutor at a local tutoring center. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I’ve worked on and my credentials.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Smoke Detector with Notifications and Email-Based Alerts</h3>
            <p>An IoT-based solution made possible with ESP-32 and ARDUINO components that enhances conventional fire detection systems with real-time remote alert capabilities. It was originally programmed to further call local authorities (122) at Quezon City but it is not recommended to include for school projects, hence removed from repo's source code.</p>
